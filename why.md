## The Backstory of WhyPrivacyMatters

We're tired of long essays explaining why privacy is important. People don't read essays. If we want understanding privacy to be accessible, we need to have a series of easily-understandable bullet points that explain why privacy matters in **clear, accessible language.**

This list is published here (whyprivacymatters.org). It has been translated into many languages, reprinted in pamphlets, and perhaps will even be made into t-shirts.

These bullet-point reasons are supposed to be self-explanatory, concise, logical, and accessible. By making them quickly available in a website, we hope that convincing others that privacy matters will be a little bit simpler.
