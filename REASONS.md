The ability to maintain privacy from governments, corporations, and our peers is fundamental to a free, democratic, and equitable society. Here's why.

* Knowledge is power; Knowledge about you is power over you. Your information will be used to manipulate the way you shop, vote, and think.
* Not all your information is yours. Information shared privately with you by friends, families, and coworkers is not yours to give away.
* Without privacy, you might be so afraid that you're being judged by others that you won't try or learn new things, even if you're not doing anything wrong.
* By exercising your right to privacy, you make it easier for others—like activists and journalists—to do so without sticking out.
* You are not and will not be judged by your own standards. Standards differ between people and organizations, and standards shift with time. Even if your behavior is deemed acceptable today, it can be held against you tomorrow.
* Sharing personal data, even with a party you trust, means it is out of your hands and at risk of being hacked or sold.
* Social boundaries are created when we are able to keep parts of our life private. You might want to prevent some people—former partners, employers, or family—from knowing certain information about you.
* Your actions can be misinterpreted, and if you aren't in control of what other people know about you, anything you do may be misinterpreted or presented in a way that reflects poorly on you.

#### In the surveillance age, dissent—which was once stifled in the streets—will be now be repressed in the mind.
