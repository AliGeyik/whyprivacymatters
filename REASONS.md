The ability to maintain privacy from governments, corporations, and our peers is fundamental to a free, democratic, and equitable society. Here's why.

1. Knowledge is power; Knowledge about you is power over you. Your information will be used to manipulate the way you shop, vote, and think.
2. If a company, government, or person has access to your personal information or private communications, they can anticipate your actions, making it nearly impossible to act against them.
3. Other's information in your control is not yours to share. Information shared privately with you by friends, family, and coworkers is not yours to give away.
4. Without privacy, you might be so afraid that you're being judged by others that you won't try or learn new things, even if you're not doing anything wrong.
5. By exercising your right to privacy, you make it easier for others, such as activists and journalists, to do so without being sticking out.
6. You are not and will not be judged by your own standards. Standards differ between people and organizations, and standards shift with time. Even if your behavior is deemed acceptable today, it can be held against you tomorrow.
7. Sharing personal data, even with a party you trust, means it is out of your control and at risk of being hacked or sold.
8. Social boundaries are created when we are able to keep parts of our life private. You might want to prevent some people, such as former partners, employers, or family, from knowing certain things about you.

#### In the surveillance age, dissent—which was once subdued in the streets—will be now be subdued in the mind.
