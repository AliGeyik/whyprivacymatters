The ability to maintain privacy from governments, corporations, and our peers is fundamental to a free, democratic, and equitable society. Here's why.

## Major points
* Knowledge is power; Knowledge about you is power over you. Your information will be used to manipulate the way you shop, vote, and think.
* You are not and will not be judged by your own standards. Standards differ between people and organizations, and standards shift with time. Even if your behavior is deemed acceptable today, it can be held against you tomorrow.
* Not all your information is yours. Information shared privately with you by friends, families, and coworkers is not yours to give away.
* Without privacy, you might be so afraid that you're being judged by others that you won't try new things, even if you're not doing anything wrong.

## Why you shouldn't allow governments to track you

## Why you shouldn't allow companies to track you
* Sending personal data to a company, even one you trust, means it is out of your hands and at risk of being hacked or sold.

## Why you shouldn't allow other people to track you
* Your actions can be misinterpreted, and if you aren't in control of what other people know about you, anything you do may be misinterpreted or presented in a way that reflects poorly on you.
